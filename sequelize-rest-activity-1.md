## **Activity: Build an Express & Sequelize API**

**Objective:** Create a simple Express API using Sequelize with MySQL and .env configuration. You will implement a CRUD API for managing events.

### 1. Setup

- Initialize a new Node.js project.
- Install required packages (`express`, `sequelize`, `mysql2`, `dotenv`).
- Setup your project structure (`models`, `services`, `routes`).
- Configure a `.env` file for your database connection.

### 2. Model Creation

- Create a Sequelize model for an `Event` with appropriate fields.
- Implement validation rules with custom error messages (you can implement these later as you need them).

**Tips**: 
- [Validators](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/validations-and-constraints/#validators) in sequelize docs.
- [Data Types](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/core-concepts/model-basics/#data-types) in sequelize docs

```text
{
  id: auto incremented integer
  name: string,
  date: date only (yyy-mm-dd),
  location: string,
  capacity: integer,
  isOnline: boolean
}
```

**Note**: Sample data is provided in [point 5](#5-dummy-data)

Validation rules:
- Event name cannot be empty and less than 100 characters.
- Date must be a valid date and cannot be in the past.
- Location cannot be empty and less than 255 characters.
- Capacity must be a positive integer of at least 1.
- IsOnline must be a boolean (true or false).

### 3. Service Layer

- Create a service class to handle data access logic.
- The service should include methods for:
  - `add`
  - `getAll`
  - `getById`
  - `update`
  - `delete`

### 4. Routes (Controller)

- Implement routes using an Express Router (`api/v1/events`).
- Setup CRUD endpoints (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`).
- Ensure appropriate status codes are used (`200`, `201`, `400`, `404`, `500`, etc.).
- Handle validation errors gracefully in the `POST` and `PUT` endpoints, returning `400` status with the validation messages.

### 5. Dummy Data

- Add 20 instances of sample event data to help with testing.

**6. Bonus Tasks**

- Create a centralized error-handling middleware to avoid repeating validation extraction logic.
- Add filtering, sorting, and pagination support to the `getAll` endpoint.
