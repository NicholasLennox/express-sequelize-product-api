# Products API with Sequelize

Class demo for our integration of sequelize into our API.

I will update the code with commnets and so on as the day goes - maybe on the weekend.

Our plan going forward is to make our responses a bit more consistent for bad requests and have a more general error handler.

Then we can start including more models and relationships and see how we can cater for related models in our routes.
